This is the implementation of ftl in javascript.

The file ftl_grammar-impl.pegjs contains grammar and classes that parses the language elements.

The test folder contains testable code for different language elements.

All test code can be run at https://pegjs.org/online by following steps (with Google Chrome browser):

1. Copy content of ftl_grammar-impl.pegjs into the left window
1. Copy content of the each test code into the right window.

The parsed function structure as well as the computation results will be shown in the right bottom window.

Also the intermittent computation results will be shown in javascript console.
